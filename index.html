		<h1>Welcome to our page! (We plan on making this prettier later :) )</h1>
		<p>This page will contain information about our VR class project, which is called <u>Junkyard Wars</u>.</p>
		</br>
		
		<p><u>Junkyard Wars</u> is a Sandbox Multiplayer Vehicle Building Simulator - going to be made with the Unity 5 game engine.
The players build a vehicle in VR that they can then drive around a map. This sandbox simulation has two modes: building and testing. Players will be able to see avatars of each other that will match head movement.

In building mode, the players can build any kind of vehicle they want out of modular pieces including wheels, frames, thrusters, and seats. In this mode, both players will be at a workstation where they are given a vehicle base. They may then add pieces onto the vehicle base and onto other pieces already attached to the vehicle.

The players can then enter testing mode to pilot their vehicle. Player 1 is placed in the driver seat (if there is one) and player 2 is placed in the passenger seat. Otherwise, players will stand nearby and watch the vehicle. Certain modular pieces of the vehicle such as wheels and thrusters can be controlled by joysticks and buttons on the XBox controllers.</p>

							Using the integrated networking system in Unity, which is called UNet, I was able to use an in-built GUI in order to make it
							create a sample environment for two players to be placed in.

							Both players can see each other, with one player being a different color from the other in order to distinguish the two. Their rotations with
							the headset are matched and they can see each other in the same world. (Seen below).

							In conclusion, some issues I have been having with the multiplayer in VR is that it looks a bit choppy and more optimization is needed.
							Fixing this problem will be my goal to achieve as I am progressing towards the second checkpoint.
