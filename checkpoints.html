  <h3>Checkpoint 1</h3><br>
  <div class="row">

      <p><b>Joe Brosnihan</b></p>
      <p>My goal throughout this checkpoint was to allow the player to attach wheels to a chasis.
      Here is the player placing the first wheel onto the chasis. It is placed according to a raycast from the camera.</p>
      <img src="images/placement1.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>The player can attach an arbitrary number of pieces to any side of a surface.<p>
      <img src = "images/placement2.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>The player can then drive the vehicle they have built by pressing Start.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <p><b>Chris Castellano</b></p>
      <p>My goal throughout this checkpoint was to create a sandbox, which would be the environment for the players to interact in.
              My first plan of action was to create a city, which would be the area in which the players start off in.</p>
      <img src = "images/cityCHRIS.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>They would be able to interact with the props, which will be objects the two players will use to build a vehicle of their choice.</p>
      <img src = "images/citywithpropsCHRIS.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>There is also another biome - the desert, which the players can access from the city.</p>
      <img src = "images/desertCHRIS.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>There is also some water in the desert in order to make the place more lively.</p>
      <img src = "images/beachCHRIS.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>My next plan of action is to integrate procedural generation with the assets and fix bounds on the map so that players can't drive off the world. Also,
              I will add different types of assets to make the scene more complete.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3"> 
      <p><b>Galen Stetsyuk</b></p> 
      <p>Models were made to account for collision placement system. Models will "snap" based on origin location.</p>
      <img src = "images/UI01.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>UI with tiles implemented for switching objects to place on the vehicle.</p>
      <img src = "images/UI02.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>Some Model with thrusters and particle systems.</p>

      <img src = "images/Thruster02.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>The UI needs to be improved in terms of functionality, and physics characteristics need to be implemented to more accurately reflect object states when placed on vehicle.</p>

      <p><b>Mikhail Sorokin</b></p>
      <p>Using the integrated networking system in Unity, which is called UNet, I was able to use an in-built GUI in order to make it
              create a sample environment for two players to be placed in.</p>
      <img src = "images/Mike-GUI.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>Created a placeholder avatar which will be useful in order to see position and rotation reflected across the network. (Seen below).</p>
      <img src = "images/Mike-Avatar.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>Both players can see each other, with one player being a different color from the other in order to distinguish the two. Their rotations with
        the headset are matched and they can see each other in the same world. (Seen below).</p>

      <img src = "images/Mike-Player Two Look Down.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>In conclusion, some issues I have been having with the multiplayer in VR is that it looks a bit choppy and more optimization is needed.
              Fixing this problem will be my goal to achieve as I am progressing towards the second checkpoint.</p>

      <p>The user can now attach any arbitrary piece selected from the catalogue of pieces displayed in Galen's UI.</p>
      <p>We did not add Axles because we decided last checkpoint to use Wheel Colliders instead.</p>

      <p>Map has been developed with much more detail. Road system is completely finished. Added areas such as a forest and baseball field.</p>

      <p>I added building functionality for the two players. If one player places an 
                object in one world, then the other player will be able to see it spawn in 
                their client view. In the picture, there was just a test with multiple wheels
                to see if this information could be sent both ways.</p>
      <img src = "images/Two Player Building Interactivity.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>A lot of wheels in front of the player's face.</p>
      <img src = "images/Smother_Wheels.png" class="img-responsive" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
      <p>I fixed the choppiness, which was evident from last time. The movement isn't flawless, which is expected,
              but it is good enough for a demo, especially for a VR one.</p>
      <p>For the last checkpoint, I plan on fixing some issues that may occur with building over the network and 
              making sure that driving is simulated over the network as well.</p>
